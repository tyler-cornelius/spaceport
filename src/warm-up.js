// Read the instructions for each of the warm up exercises carefully. This may
// seem repititious or pedandtic at first, however it's very important that you
// become comfortable with these fundamental concepts. Do not move on to
// iteration 1 until you are confident that you've completed all of iteration 0.


//------------------------- Variables -------------------------//

// Initialize two new variables, "name", and "age", and assign values to them with
// your own name and age.

var name = "Tyler"
var age = 25


// Initialize a new variable "someThing", but leave it undefined

var someThing = undefined

// Initialize a new variable "isHuman", and assign it to a boolean value of your
// choice

var isHuman = true

// Reassign (not initialize) your "age" variable from above. Use a built in math
// operator to make your age half of what it currently is.

age = 27 / 2

// Create a variable named "greeting", and assign it to a greeting of your
// choice. Your chosen greeting must make use of your "name" variable from above

var greeting = "Howdy " + name + "!"

// Create a new variable named "isMinor", and use a comparison operator to
// assign a boolean value to this variable. If "age" is less than 18, the
// variable should be true, otherwise it should be false. You MUST use a
// comparison operator.

var isMinor = age < 18


//------------------------- Conditionals -------------------------//


// Express the following in code: If the variable age is greater than 100 log
// the statement 'Oh! So old!', otherwise, log the statement 'Still a spring
// chicken!'
if (age > 100) {
  console.log ("Oh! So old!")
} else {
  console.log ("Still a spring chicken!")
}




// Express the following in code: If the length of the variable name is longer
// the 5 characters, log the statement 'Hi there [name]!'. Otherwise, log the
// statement 'Well hello [name]'. In either case, the value stored in the name
// variable should be included in the logged statement.
if (age.length > 5){
  console.log ("Hi there " + name + "!")
} else {
  console.log ("Well hello " + name)
}



//------------------------- Arrays -------------------------//

// Create a new variable "numbers" and assign it to an Array of 10 different
// numbers

var numbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

// Write the code to access the 5th element of the Array, using bracket
// notation.
console.log (numbers[4])

// Create a new variable "planets" and assign it to an Array the 8 planets in
// our solar system, represented by their names as Strings.
var planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]

// Write the code to access the 7th planet from the sun, using bracket notation.
console.log (planets[6])

//------------------------- Objects -------------------------//

// Create a new variable "planet" and assign to it an object literal with two
// keys: name, and hasWater. The value for name should the string 'Earth', and
// the value for hasWater should be true
var planet = {
  name: "Earth",
  hasWater: true,
}

// Write the code to add the key of habitable, with the value of true. Use dot
// notation to do this. DO NOT modify your code from above.
planet.habitable = true
